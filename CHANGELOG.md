# Change log

Started as MetPy's stock "Simple Sounding" example. Summary of everything
changed since, roughly in the order it happened.

See [README.md](README.md) for how the thing works today; this file is
history, and Part 1 below describes a single-file script that has since
been split into modules.

# Part 2 — modeled profiles, and the split into modules

## Modeled soundings at an arbitrary point

- `--lat`/`--lon` fetch a **modeled** vertical profile instead of an
  observed radiosonde, so a "sounding" can be had anywhere, hourly,
  rather than only at a launch site twice a day. Priority chain
  `rrfs -> hrrr -> gfs`, overridable with `--model`.
- HRRR and RRFS are read as **raw GRIB2 from NOAA's S3 buckets**. An
  earlier THREDDS-based attempt was abandoned: HRRR's THREDDS feed only
  exposes 5 pressure levels, nowhere near enough for a sounding. Herbie
  resolves which run/source exists and parses the `.idx` sidecar into
  byte ranges; the fetch itself is a parallel range-request pull, because
  Herbie's own `.download()` fetched messages one at a time and took over
  10 minutes for a request this wide.
- GFS stayed on THREDDS/NCSS (`thredds.py`) — server-side subsetting, no
  GRIB decode needed, and it's only the coarse global fallback anyway.
- `--run-datetime`/`--forecast-hour` pin an exact run and lead instead of
  resolving one from a valid time.
- `--name` adds an arbitrary label above the geocoded location, so a site
  can carry your own name for it rather than the nearest town's.

## Getting the vertical profile right

- **Terrain trim.** Isobaric fields are extrapolated below ground by
  NOAA's post-processing rather than left missing, so levels underneath
  the model's own orography were being plotted as if they were real air.
  Verified directly: Palomar (673 m terrain) had its 1000/975/950 mb
  levels at 126/348/575 m, all below its own ground. Levels below the
  grid's terrain height are now dropped.
- **Native/hybrid levels.** HRRR's `nat` product is merged in alongside
  the 25 mb isobaric steps, giving 2-3x the near-surface resolution (its
  level 1 measured ~11 m AGL). Written model-agnostically: RRFS publishes
  no native-level product yet, so it is a no-op there and will pick it up
  automatically if that changes.
- **A real surface row.** The biggest correctness fix of the lot. The
  "surface parcel" was being launched from the lowest *isobaric* level
  that survived the terrain trim — fine for HRRR at ~11 m AGL, badly
  wrong for RRFS, whose lowest retained level measured **150-230 m AGL**
  across these sites. The model's own 2 m temperature ran **3.6-4.6 °C
  warmer** than the air up there, which reads as RRFS under-forecasting
  surface heating when it does nothing of the kind. The model's surface
  diagnostics (2 m temperature/dewpoint, 10 m wind, surface pressure) are
  now prepended as the profile's ground row, for every model. Thermal
  tops went from 722→1,179 m at Little Black, 825→1,401 m at Palomar,
  1,058→1,521 m at Marshall.
- **Grid-relative winds.** HRRR/RRFS `u`/`v` are relative to the Lambert
  Conformal grid, not true north, and would point wrong everywhere off
  the central meridian. Rotated using the cone constant and central
  meridian read from each message's own metadata, not hardcoded.
- **Longitude convention.** eccodes reports grid longitudes in 0-360.
  Querying the nearest-point tree with a raw -180..180 value silently
  matched coastal British Columbia for a San Diego query before this was
  caught.

## Parcel and lapse-rate panel

- The modeled parcel is always the **surface** parcel (not MetPy's
  most-unstable search), since these plots are about surface-driven
  convection, with the ±1 °C uncertainty band kept.
- Mixing-top validity check: the −1 °C parcel often never intersects the
  environment at all, and the underlying routine reported its LCL as if
  it were a cloud base. Such a top is now rejected rather than drawn.
- Parcel-minus-environment temperature is plotted on the lapse-rate panel
  on its own twinned x-axis (the two quantities don't share units).
- A CAPE shading experiment was added and reverted — it didn't render
  well, and these dry profiles have essentially no CAPE anyway.

## Structure

- **Made importable.** The script parsed `sys.argv` and ran the entire
  fetch-and-plot at module scope, so merely importing it rendered and
  wrote a plot. Everything moved into `main(args=None, output_dir=None)`
  behind a `__main__` guard.
- **Split into modules** along the seams already marked by comment
  banners: `grib.py`, `thredds.py`, `wyoming.py`, `skewt.py`,
  `lapse_rate.py`, `geocode.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`, with
  `Simple_Sounding.py` left as the entry point. Verified by
  byte-identical plot output before and after.
- **Backend switched from QtAgg to Agg.** Everything goes through
  `savefig`, and a GUI backend needs a display present *at import time*,
  which breaks on a headless host now that the bot imports this directly.

## Telegram bot

- `/sounding [station] [datetime]`, `/site <name> [datetime]`, `/sites`.
  Named sites come from `sites.tsv`, matched longest-prefix first so
  multi-word names survive having a datetime appended.
- Runs the render **in-process** rather than shelling out, on a worker
  thread behind a lock (pyplot is global state). It previously identified
  its own output by picking the newest matching PNG off disk, which two
  overlapping requests could get wrong.
- `httpx` request logging pinned to WARNING: the Telegram API puts the
  bot token in the URL path, and at INFO it was written in clear text to
  whatever the bot's output was redirected to.
- Runs as a systemd user service (`weather-sounding-bot.service`) with
  the token in a mode-600 `EnvironmentFile`.

## Also found along the way

- 1000 mb is the highest isobaric level either model publishes; there is
  no 1025/1050 mb to extend down to for high pressure.
- RRFS's native-level product (`natlev`) is real and documented but not
  yet populated on the operational bucket, consistent with RRFS still
  being pre-implementation (v1 scheduled 2026-10-14).
- RAP is the only other source publishing both pressure *and* native
  levels, but its native archive only reaches back to ~May 2021 and its
  13 km terrain is far too coarse for ridge sites.
- HRRR's `wrfnat` has an archive gap from 2016-08-23 to ~2016-09-30
  (`wrfprs` is fine throughout). The same gap appears on the Google
  mirror, so it is upstream. The native-level fetch degrades to
  isobaric-only there rather than failing.

# Part 1 — the original single-file script

## Configuration (CLI args)

Originally these were environment variables (`SOUNDING_STATION`,
`ALTITUDE_UNIT`); converted to proper `argparse` flags for discoverability
(`--help` documents them) and so a single shell command captures the full
invocation instead of needing exported env vars alongside it.

- `--station STATION` — station identifier, e.g. `NKX` (default: `NKX`).
- `--altitude-unit {km,kft}` — unit for the MSL altitude axis (default:
  `km`). `km` ticks every 1 km; `kft` (thousands of feet, `KM_TO_KFT =
  3.280839895`) ticks every 3 kft.
- `--datetime` — UTC date/time of the sounding run to plot, e.g.
  `"2025-01-01T12"` or `"2025-01-01 12:00"` (default: the latest
  available 00Z/12Z run). Accepts a handful of formats via
  `parse_datetime()`.

`SHOW_PREVIOUS` (overlay the prior run) is still a plain `True`/`False`
constant in the script, not yet exposed as a flag.

## Rendering / display

- **Backend switched to QtAgg** (`matplotlib.use('QtAgg')`, `PyQt6`
  installed into the venv). The original `TkAgg` backend rendered the
  window at the wrong pixel size under GNOME's fractional display scaling
  on Wayland (Tk has no native Wayland support and runs via XWayland,
  which doesn't handle fractional scaling correctly). Qt handles it fine.
- Fixed an invalid `figsize=(9, 9, "in")` call (matplotlib silently
  ignored the stray `"in"`; now just `(9, 9)`/`(7.5, 10)`).
- `SkewT(..., aspect='auto')` plus tighter `xlim`/`ylim` so the skewed
  plot area fills the figure instead of leaving large blank margins
  (MetPy's default fixed `aspect=80.5` centers a fixed-shape box with
  padding regardless of the figure's actual dimensions).
- Title added via `skew.ax.set_title()` (not `fig.suptitle()` — the
  latter anchors to the whole figure and left a large gap above the
  axes; `set_title()` sits directly above the plot).

## Data fetching

- **Latest-synoptic-time lookup**: `latest_synoptic_time()` rounds down
  to the most recent 00Z/12Z launch; `fetch_recent_sounding()` retries
  12 hours further back (up to 4 tries) since a sounding takes ~1-2
  hours to post after launch.
- **Local caching**: fetched soundings are saved as CSV under
  `cache/<station>_<run>.csv`; re-running the script re-reads the cache
  instead of re-hitting the Wyoming archive. Cache is per-run, so it
  never goes stale for a past sounding.
- **Open-Meteo integration** (`requests`, no API key): pulls that day's
  high temperature for the sounding station's own coordinates (read
  straight from the fetched sounding's `latitude`/`longitude` columns),
  plus the station's local UTC offset/timezone abbreviation used for the
  title and legend times.
- **Forecast vs. historical Open-Meteo endpoint**: dates within ~90 days
  use the live `/v1/forecast` endpoint (real forecast high, legend reads
  "Forecast high"); older dates automatically switch to the
  `/v1/archive` historical endpoint instead (actual observed high,
  legend reads "Observed high") — the live forecast endpoint doesn't
  serve data that far back, which matters for the 2025 batch runs below.

## Plot content

- Fixed a copy/paste bug: `np.arange(22, 24, 26, 28)` (4 positional args
  misinterpreted the 4th as a `dtype`) → an explicit `np.array([...])`.
- **`plot_clipped_dry_adiabats()`**: a hand-rolled replacement for
  MetPy's `plot_dry_adiabats()`, which has no awareness of the actual
  temperature profile and draws full-height reference lines. This
  version computes each dry adiabat, finds where it first crosses the
  environmental temperature curve going up from the surface, and draws
  only the segment below that crossing — so lines stop where they meet
  real data instead of running the full plot height.
- **Forecast-high adiabat**: the Open-Meteo forecast high is drawn as
  a special dry adiabat (the "convective temperature" technique) —
  where it crosses the morning sounding shows the forecast afternoon
  mixed-layer depth.
- **Previous-sounding overlay** (`SHOW_PREVIOUS` toggle): the prior
  synoptic run's temperature/dewpoint traces are overlaid on the same
  axes as dashed, faded (`alpha=0.4`) lines for comparison, labeled with
  their local time in the legend. (An earlier side-by-side two-panel
  version was tried and reverted in favor of this simpler overlay.)

## Axes

- **MSL altitude axis**: originally added as a secondary axis using
  MetPy's `pressure_to_height_std`/`height_to_pressure_std` (a fixed
  ICAO standard-atmosphere formula). Replaced with
  `make_msl_height_functions()`, which interpolates the sounding's own
  reported `height` column (real geopotential height, MSL-referenced)
  instead — this reflects the atmosphere actually observed that run,
  not a theoretical one.
- **Axis roles swapped**: MSL altitude (km) is now the primary
  (innermost) y-axis, capped at a 6000 m `ylim` (converted to the
  equivalent pressure bound via the sounding's own data, since the
  underlying SkewT projection is always pressure/log-p internally).
  Pressure (hPa) was moved to a secondary, outer axis.
- Along the way, fixed axis-label collisions (widened the figure,
  adjusted secondary-axis offsets/`labelpad`), a mismatched unit label
  (axis said "(m)" while actually plotting km), scientific-notation tick
  labels on log-scale secondary axes (explicit `FixedLocator`/
  `FuncFormatter` instead of the default log formatter), and a stray
  auto-generated "hectopascal" label (Pint/MetPy's matplotlib units
  integration auto-labels axes from Quantity units; needed an explicit
  `skew.ax.set_ylabel('')` to clear it).
- **`--altitude-unit kft`**: `make_msl_height_functions()` takes a `unit`
  argument and scales the interpolated heights by `KM_TO_KFT`; tick
  spacing switches to every 3 kft (vs. every 1 km) accordingly.
- **Dashed MSL altitude gridlines**: `alt_ax.grid()` silently produced
  gridline artists that never actually rendered — matplotlib's secondary
  axis gridline transform gets confused when the secondary axis's range
  is inverted (low pressure/high altitude at the top of the plot).
  Worked around by drawing the dashed lines directly on `skew.ax` via
  `axhline()`, at the pressure value each altitude tick converts to.

## Export

- `fig.savefig(..., dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')` for a web-friendly
  PNG (2x pixel density for high-DPI screens, no dead margin).
- Matching `.svg` export for vector use.

## Housekeeping

- Dropped dead weight left over from the original MetPy example: unused
  `col_names`, the unused `get_test_data`/`add_metpy_logo` imports, and
  the `plt.rcParams['figure.figsize']` line (dead since `figsize` is
  always passed explicitly to `plt.figure()` now).
- Fixed a handful of formatting artifacts from iterative edits (stray
  trailing whitespace, a title line split across two f-strings for no
  reason, misaligned wrapped function signature).

## Historical / batch runs

With `--datetime`, the script can plot any past 00Z/12Z run, not just
the latest one. Example — the 1st of every month at 12Z for 2025:

```bash
for m in 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12; do
    python Simple_Sounding.py --datetime "2025-${m}-01T12"
done
```

Produces `NKX_2025<MM>01_12Z.png`/`.svg` for each month. (One run, for
September, needed a longer-than-60s timeout on the Wyoming archive
fetch on retry — a transient slow response, not missing data.)

## Not done

- Looked into Meteoblue support in `siphon` — it isn't there (`siphon`
  only wraps ACIS, IA State, IGRA2, NDBC, and Wyoming). Would need a
  direct API call, same pattern as the Open-Meteo integration.
